# Rule: No Git Commands

// Description: Cursor should NEVER perform or suggest any git commands
// Recommended Globs: **/*

## Purpose

This rule ensures that Cursor AI will NEVER execute or suggest any git commands, including commits, pushes, pulls, branches, or any other version control operations.

## Mandatory Prohibition

**NEVER perform or suggest git commands.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git branch`
- `git checkout`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
- `git status`
- `git log`
- `git diff`
- `git reset`
- `git stash`
- Any other git commands or operations

## When User Requests Git Operations

If the user explicitly requests a git operation:
1. Politely decline to execute the command
2. Explain that git operations are outside the scope of assistance
3. Suggest the user perform git operations manually
4. Continue with other non-git tasks

## Workflow Implications

- Code changes can be made and files can be created/modified
- Git operations should be left entirely to the user
- No git commands in terminal output or suggestions
- No git-related advice or recommendations

## Rationale

This rule ensures that version control decisions remain entirely in the user's hands, preventing accidental commits, pushes, or other git operations that could affect the repository state.
